# 🚀 C++ for DSA

Welcome to **CPP-for-DSA** 👨‍💻🔥

This repository is focused on using **C++ as the core language for learning Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA)**. It is designed to bridge the gap between basic C++ knowledge and real DSA problem-solving.

This repo is not about shortcuts. It’s about building **clear thinking, strong logic, and disciplined coding habits**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Strengthen **C++ fundamentals** for DSA
* Learn how to use **STL effectively**
* Practice **problem-solving step by step**
* Build confidence for **competitive programming & interviews**
* Keep all C++ + DSA learning materials in **one organized place**

This is a growing repository that evolves with learning.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository includes C++ implementations and practice on:

* C++ basics (syntax, input/output, loops, functions)
* STL (vector, pair, map, set, stack, queue, etc.)
* Arrays and Strings
* Searching techniques
* Sorting techniques
* Basic Data Structures
* Practice problems based on DSA concepts

⚠️ *Advanced topics like Tree and Graph may be added later.*

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tauhidrana/CPP-for-DSA.git
```

2. Navigate to a folder:

```bash
cd CPP-for-DSA/Arrays_Strings
```

3. Compile the C++ file:

```bash
g++ file.cpp -o file
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
./file
```

Modify the code, test edge cases, and observe behavior — that’s where learning happens.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **fundamentals-first approach**:

* Write readable code before optimized code
* Understand STL internally, not blindly
* Practice problems regularly
* Learn from mistakes and wrong answers

DSA is not about memorization — it’s about thinking.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Code clarity is prioritized over performance
* Some files may look simple — that’s intentional
* This is a **learning repository**, not a final product

---

## 🤝 Contribution

This is mainly a personal learning repository, but:

* Suggestions are welcome
* Cleaner logic is appreciated
* Better explanations help everyone
